# Column Comments & Masks

SDP-META can attach two kinds of Unity Catalog column-level governance to the
Bronze and Silver target tables directly from the onboarding file:

- **Column comments** — free-text documentation attached to a column.
- **Column masks** — Unity Catalog dynamic data masking: a registered UC
  masking function is applied to a column so unprivileged readers see a
  redacted value.

Both are declared as JSON objects keyed by column name.

## Configuration

Add `*_column_comments` and/or `*_column_masks` to an onboarding entry
(`bronze_` and `silver_` variants are both supported):

```json
{
  "data_flow_id": "1",
  "data_flow_group": "customers_group",
  "source_format": "delta",
  "silver_catalog_dev": "my_catalog",
  "silver_database_dev": "retail_silver",
  "silver_table": "customers_silver",
  "silver_transformation_json_dev": "/Volumes/.../silver_transformations.json",
  "silver_column_comments": {
    "customer_id": "Stable surrogate key",
    "ssn": "Social security number (masked for non-privileged readers)"
  },
  "silver_column_masks": {
    "ssn": "my_catalog.security.mask_ssn USING COLUMNS (region)"
  }
}
```

### Mask clause syntax

A mask value is spliced after `MASK` in the generated table DDL, so it uses
the Unity Catalog column-mask clause form:

```
<catalog>.<schema>.<function> [USING COLUMNS (<col>, ...)]
```

The masking function must already exist in Unity Catalog. The optional
`USING COLUMNS (...)` list passes additional columns to the function (for
conditional masking). Examples:

- `my_catalog.security.mask_ssn`
- `my_catalog.security.mask_ssn USING COLUMNS (region, tier)`

## How it is applied

When comments or masks are set, SDP-META derives the target table's schema
and renders it as a **DDL-string schema** — `` `col` type [NOT NULL] [COMMENT
'...'] [MASK <clause>] `` — which it passes to the generated Lakeflow
Declarative Pipeline table. (Column masks cannot be expressed through a
`StructType`; Unity Catalog only reads them from a DDL schema.) Comments and
masks are applied to the main target table across the standard, data-quality,
CDC apply-changes, and append-flow write paths.

### Combined `bronze_silver` topology

Silver column comments/masks are supported in **both** pipeline topologies:

- the **split** topology (a bronze pipeline, then a separate silver pipeline), and
- the **combined** `bronze_silver` topology (one pipeline that builds bronze and
  silver in the same run — e.g. the multi-source AUTO CDC demo).

A silver table derives its schema from its transform applied to the upstream
bronze table. In a combined run the bronze table is *produced in the same run*
and does not yet exist in Unity Catalog when the graph is built, so SDP-META
does **not** read it to resolve the silver policy schema. Instead it derives the
silver schema from the bronze dataflowspec's declared schema in-process, then
applies the silver transform to it:

- **Effective (target) schema, not the raw input schema.** The mapped bronze
  schema is the declared `source_schema_path` schema **augmented with the
  columns the bronze reader injects into the materialised target** — the
  `cloudFiles` rescued-data column (default `_rescued_data`, or your
  `cloudFiles.rescuedDataColumn`) and any autoloader metadata columns
  (`include_autoloader_metadata_column` / `select_metadata_cols`). So a silver
  `selectExp` that references `_rescued_data` (or a metadata column) resolves in
  a combined run exactly as it does against the physical table in the split
  topology.
- **Single-source and multi-source AUTO CDC.** For a standard silver spec the
  `selectExp` / `whereClause` is applied to the bronze target schema. For a
  **multi-source AUTO CDC** silver spec (`silver_cdc_apply_changes_flows`), each
  flow's source is resolved against its bronze schema, that flow's `select_exp`
  / `where_clause` is applied, and the per-flow schemas are merged (they must be
  compatible — same columns and types — since all flows land in one streaming
  table).

**Requirements & fail-fast.** In a combined run a bronze source feeding a
silver table with masks/comments **must have a declared schema**
(`source_schema_path`). If it does not — or if the silver transform references a
column that is not in the declared+augmented bronze schema (for example a column
added by a bronze `custom_transform_func`, which is not statically knowable) —
SDP-META **fails fast at graph-construction time** with an actionable error that
names the split-pipeline workaround, rather than surfacing an opaque
`TABLE_OR_VIEW_NOT_FOUND`. In those cases, declare the missing column in the
bronze source schema, or run bronze and silver as **separate pipelines** (the
split topology reads the already-materialised bronze table and has no such
restriction). Note that a `selectExp` of `*` cannot be statically validated
against a `custom_transform_func`'s output; prefer explicit column lists on a
silver table that carries policies in a combined run.

## Rules & limitations

- **Masks are Unity Catalog only.** On a non-UC pipeline, masks are silently
  dropped (mirroring row filters). Comments work on any Delta table.
- **Masks fail closed.** If a mask names a column that is not in the derived
  schema, onboarding/deploy raises an error rather than silently skipping it —
  a dropped mask would leave a column unexpectedly unprotected. A comment on an
  unknown column is skipped with a warning instead.
- **A declared schema is required for masks.** Silver derives its schema from
  the transform, so masks work out of the box. A Bronze table with an inferred
  schema (no `bronze_schema`) cannot carry masks — supply a schema, or apply
  masks on the Silver table.
- **Reader-injected columns are auto-appended to the bronze policy schema.**
  On the standard (non-CDC) bronze write path, when comments/masks are
  configured SDP-META renders an explicit schema so it can attach the DDL. DLT
  otherwise infers the query schema — which includes the columns the reader
  adds on top of your declared `source_schema_path` — so the two must match or
  table creation fails with a schema-incompatibility error. You do **not** need
  to hand-enumerate those reader columns in `source_schema_path`: SDP-META
  augments the bronze policy schema to match what the reader produces. What IS
  auto-appended (for a `cloudFiles` source):
    - the **rescued-data column** — `_rescued_data`, or your custom
      `cloudFiles.rescuedDataColumn` / `rescuedDataColumn` name — as `string`;
    - when `include_autoloader_metadata_column` is set, the **file-metadata
      column** (your `autoloader_metadata_col_name`, else `source_metadata`, or
      `_metadata` when the flag is present-and-false) as the standard
      file-metadata struct;
    - any `select_metadata_cols` projections, typed from the `_metadata` struct
      when they project one of its fields, else `string`.

  Columns you already list in `source_schema_path` are never duplicated, and
  the appended order matches the reader (declared columns first, then rescued
  data, then the metadata struct, then the projected metadata columns).

  What is **NOT** auto-augmented, so you must still declare it yourself (or
  policies on it will fail):
    - non-`cloudFiles` bronze sources (delta / kafka / eventhub) get no
      reader-column augmentation — only the declared schema is used;
    - columns added by a bronze `custom_transform_func` or a `select_exp` —
      these are not statically knowable, so enumerate any policied ones in the
      declared schema;
    - the **CDC** bronze paths (`cdcApplyChanges` / multi-source AUTO CDC) and
      the **DQE** write path are out of scope for this auto-augmentation — a
      column policy there must match the schema those paths render.
- **Quarantine tables** do not receive column masks in this version (masking
  rejected rows would hide the very values operators need to triage them, and
  the mask map is keyed to the main table's columns).
- **SCD type 2 snapshot targets require a declared version type.** An SCD2
  `apply_changes_from_snapshot` table carries DLT-managed `__START_AT` /
  `__END_AT` system columns typed to the snapshot *version*. Unlike the regular
  CDC path, the snapshot config has no `sequence_by` to derive that type from
  (the version is produced at runtime by the `next_snapshot_and_version`
  callable / snapshot source and cannot be introspected safely at graph-build
  time), so the type must be declared explicitly:
    - Set `snapshot_version_type` on the `apply_changes_from_snapshot` block to
      a canonical Spark/DDL type string (e.g. `"long"` or `"timestamp"`). The
      pipeline then injects correctly-typed `__START_AT` / `__END_AT` into the
      explicit schema and attaches the comments/masks. **The version returned
      at runtime MUST conform to this declared type** — a mismatch surfaces as
      an explicit table-create / insert failure (validatable), not a silently
      wrong schema.
    - The **first-party Delta snapshot-source mode** (`snapshot_format: delta`)
      contractually guarantees the version is the Delta commit version, so it
      defaults `snapshot_version_type` to `long` when none is declared. A custom
      `next_snapshot_and_version` callback does **not** get this default, even
      if it happens to read Delta.
    - When neither a declared type nor the Delta-source mode applies (or no
      schema is available to attach the policies to), the pipeline **fails
      closed** rather than emit a schema missing those columns or silently drop
      a mask. Use **SCD type 1** for column policies on a snapshot target, or
      apply the `COMMENT` / `MASK` with a separate `ALTER TABLE` after the table
      is created. SCD1 snapshot targets are unaffected.
